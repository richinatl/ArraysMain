# ArraysMain

## Description

This was a couple of excercises for Arrays in Java, one to create a sum for a given array, and one to create an array with values increased expotentially. There has been
a bit of a learning curve so far with Java vs the JavaScript that I've spent much more time with, but everything is starting to click, little by little. This is one of the things
I really enjoy about software development, there's always something new to learn, and there always will be. Next up I will be getting into a bit more detailed projects which I am looking forward to

---
I was also given a code snippet to describe what it does and what the output is. Once the errors were correct the output was 2. It finds the index of the largest number in a given array

```             
        double[ ] exampleArray = {1,5,6,5,4,1};

        double maximum = exampleArray[0];

        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < exampleArray.length; i++){

             if (exampleArray[ i ] > maximum) {

                  maximum = exampleArray[ i ];

                  index = i;

             }

        }

        System.out.println(index);
```
